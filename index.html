        <p>The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the MTA into a budget crisis and the MTA Board has been left to come up with solutions to combat its financial losses.

          The MTA called for the federal government to approve the HEROES Act which will provide $32 billion in emergency relief for public transit authorities nationwide. The MTA has requested $12 billion, as it is the largest public
          transportation agency in North America and is experiencing over $200 million in revenue losses every week.

        <P> At its monthly joint board and committee meeting Nov. 18, the MTA provided New Yorkers with an update on the agency's current financial situation, expected financial deficits, and proposed actions to address the financial losses
          generated
          by COVID-19. </P>

        At its monthly joint board and committee meeting Nov. 18, the MTA provided New Yorkers with an update on the agency's current financial situation, expected financial deficits, and proposed actions to address the financial losses generated by
        COVID-19.

        Without being given the requested $12 billion in emergency federal aid, Chairman and CEO of the MTA Patrick Foye, said that the MTA would be forced to “take draconian actions.” These actions include service cuts up to 40% on subways and buses
        and 50% cuts of the commuter railroads services. Potential layoffs could also impact over 9,000 MTA workers.

      <P> As drops in ridership continue, an additional above 4% fare and toll increase is also on the table. </p>

      <p> “While ridership and revenues have started to rebound, they have not recovered enough to meaningfully improve our financial position,” Foye said. </p>

      <p> Robert Foran, the MTA’s chief financial officer, said that the potential service cuts and changes would not happen until 2021. Currently, according to Foran, the MTA is “preparing for the worst” when it comes to budget deficits.

        In projected “worst case” scenario models, Foran says that the MTA will enter 2021 with a $4.4 billion deficit, a $4.9 billion deficit in 2022, a $3.3 billion deficit in 2023 and at $3.1 billion deficit in 2024. </p>
      </p>

      <p> Foye acknowledged that the proposed budget would impact essential workers, people of color and poorer communities the most, hurting the city’s economy. </p>
      <p> “We know that any reduction in service will hurt the city and the region, including customers who need us most. Without the certainty of substantial federal dollars, there is no recourse,” he said. “We must plan for the worst while hoping
        for the best in the wake of a crisis that has done more damage to our finances than even the Great Depression in the thirties.”

      <p> The MTA board will be presented with and will place a final vote on the 2021 budget this month. </p>
